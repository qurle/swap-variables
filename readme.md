# Swap Variables for Figma
Just like Swap Libraries, but for variables

![Swap Variables cover](https://github.com/qurle/swap-variables/blob/main/assets/cover.png?raw=true)

## **How to use**

**Just run it** from the Quick Actions or Plugin menu.
Choose source and destination variable collections and give it some moments.

Alternatively, you can select some layers. The plugin will swap variables they contain.

## **How it works**

You choose *from* and *to*, plugin replaces them for you.

## Possible features
- [x] Clickable error allows to zoom in problematic layers
- [x] Collections with 0 variables are hidden
- [ ] Display number of variables in collection
- [ ] "From" fields are preselected with variable that layers contain
- [ ] Selecting the option that's in second select makes them swap

## **Problem? Idea? Kind words?**

I accept feature suggestions and ideas to improve the plugin. No need to mess with locked layers? Rename on all pages at once? Useful exceptions? If you have any ideas or issues, let me know in the comments.

Or you can contact me via e-mail at [nick.denq@gmail.com](mailto:nick.denq@gmail.com?subject=Swap%20Variables) and [Telegram](http://t.me/qurle).
