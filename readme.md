# Swap Variables for Figma
Just like Swap Libraries, but for variables

![<Plugin name covers>](https://github.com/qurle/swap-variables/blob/main/assets/cover.png?raw=true)

## **How to use**

**Just run it** from the Quick Actions or Plugin menu. 

Alternatively, you can select some layers. The plugin will swap variables they contain.

## **How it works**

You choose *from* and *to*, plugin replaces them for you.

## Possible features
[] "From" fiels is preselected with variable that layers contain
[] Selecting the option that's in second select makes them swap
[] Clickable error allows to select problematic layers

## **Problem? Idea? Kind words?**

I accept feature suggestions and ideas to improve the plugin. No need to mess with locked layers? Rename on all pages at once? Useful exceptions? If you have any ideas or issues, let me know in the comments.

Or you can contact me via e-mail at [nick.denq@gmail.com](mailto:nick.denq@gmail.com?subject=<Plugin%20for%Figma>) and [Telegram](http://t.me/qurle).
